4;209;https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets;1;There is value on VEX files and it was something we're thinking about even before the PR;4;At least people using the software will know about the weaknesses of the software/library. All the discussions by the way should consider also the CVEs' quality. In the world of bug bounties/CVE stats/CVE explosion, one important thing should also get back to have a good quality CVEs, because at this stage there's a lot of noise and false positives.;2024-07-04 08:57:58;2024-07-04 09:01:27

All of them relate to a valid protest against the Russian war.;2;There are services available that show the vulnerabilities for a given SBOM. This approach is better than having them in a static file that needs updating several times.;2024-10-11 17:32:03;2024-10-11 17:36:35
8;135;https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu;2;I had actually already updated the problematic component but had forgotten to update the SBOM.  So instead of accepting the PR, I updated the SBOM and cut a new release.  Thank you very much for bringing this to my attention.;5;Security disclosure is of prime importance in modern Open Source Software;2024-10-23 16:10:05;2024-10-23 16:12:20
9;584;https://github.com/pentagridsec/smsgate/pulls;3;So far, the issues in dependencies are likely not affecting the user/operator. Nevertheless, I update the dependencies immediately. However, keeping track of documentation takes too much time without proper tooling. If it were a single command line, I would support VEX.;4;As written above, just updating dependencies and SBOM is much easier than managing things. It could be easy with proper tooling.;2024-11-04 13:30:04;2024-11-04 13:39:48
